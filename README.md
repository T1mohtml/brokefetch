## What is this?

`brokefetch` is the only system info tool that doesn't pretend your life is okay.

Inspired by `neofetch`, but with:
- Sadness
- Regret
- A CRT monitor

# Important note!

- `brokefetch.sh` - Stable, "just works"
- `brokefetch_beta.sh` - Might contain bugs, has the newest features
- `brokefetch_EDGE_legacy.sh` - just a backup of the old edge version (currently not present)
- `brokefetch_mod.sh` - a version of EDGE that loads the logos from ~/.config/brokefetch/logos (mod stands for **mod**ular). Currently supports 485 ascii logos!

(brokefetch_EDGE got renamed to brokefetch_beta)

# Troubleshooting
