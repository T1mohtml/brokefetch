## What is this?

`brokefetch` is the only system info tool that doesn't pretend your life is okay.

Inspired by `neofetch`, but with:
- Sadness
- Regret
- A CRT monitor

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Szerwigi1410/brokefetch
cd brokefetch
chmod +x brokefetch.sh
./brokefetch.sh
```
## or use the installer "OS-wide"(experemental)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Szerwigi1410/brokefetch/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash

```

## You can also now get it from homebrew
```bash
brew tap T1mohtml/brokefetch
brew install brokefetch
```

## Important note!

- `brokefetch.sh` - Stable, "just works"
- `brokefetch_EDGE.sh` - Might contain bugs, has the newest features
- `brokefetch_EDGE_legacy.sh` - just a backup of the old edge version
